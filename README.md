## 重要事项 Important issue

收到部分玩家反馈 Aquamino 卡顿严重且严重影响操作，常会突然卡死，甚至出现帧率不到 1 的情况。

开发者本人在自家的旧电脑上测试未发现此类问题，游戏可以流畅运行，不知道这种情况是不是和电脑型号有关。

理想情况下，游戏左下角的的 TPS 数值应稳定在一个三位数且没有较大波动，FPS 数值应几乎等于用户设置。

开发者会尽力优化代码直到游戏不会再卡顿为止。若游戏出现严重卡顿，请开 issue 描述详细情况或联系开发者。

The developer have received feedback from some players that Aquamino has serious lags and seriously affects the operation. It often freezes suddenly and even has a FPS of less than 1.

The developer himself did not find such problems when testing on his old computer at home. The game can run smoothly， don’t know if this situation is related to the computer model.

Ideally, the TPS value in the lower left corner of the game should be stable at a number bigger than 100 without large fluctuations, and the FPS value should be almost equal to the user setting.

The developer will try his best to optimize the code until the game no longer lags. If serious lag happened, please open an issue and describe the details, or contact to the developer.

## 游戏简介

**Aquamino**，算是我作为一个方块玩家的想法集成地。我不希望我脑子里的想法到最后全部沦为一句空谈。

## 游玩须知

游戏路径须为纯英文，否则程序会因为找不到 ColdClear 而报错。

请根据自己使用的系统（Windows、Linux 等）选择 ColdClear 库（.dll、.so 等）。

移动端暂不支持使用 ColdClear，因此塔防与对战两个模式无法游玩。

## Introduction

**Aquamino**, a collection of my thoughts as a block player. I don't want all the ideas in my head to end up being just empty talk.

## Notes for playing

The game path must be in pure English, otherwise the program will report an error because it cannot find ColdClear.

Please select the ColdClear library (.dll, .so, etc.) according to your system (Windows, Linux, etc.).

The mobile terminal does not currently support the use of ColdClear, so the Tower Defense and Battle modes cannot be played.
